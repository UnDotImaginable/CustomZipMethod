# CustomZipMethod

The objective was to create a custom version of Python's zip method. This method allows the user to combine two lists into one big list of tuples where each tuple contains one element from each list (it's essentially pairs of elements).

This method does something similar (although it may not be as efficient, given time complexity is O(n)). Maybe?

Took a while to figure this out lol

BTW this was an exercise I found on this URL: https://www.101computing.net/zip-it-python-challenge/
